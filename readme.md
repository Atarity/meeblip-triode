⚠️ This is just a **clone** of original [Meeblip Triode repo](https://github.com/MeeBlip/meeblip-triode) . I changed layout for SPDT switches to MTS-120 cause there is no chance to buy original ones in my location. Switches looks like this:

I've also compiled comprehensive BOM for Triode synth on Octopart:
- [System board BOM](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/68w582wg)
- [Control board BOM](https://octopart.com/bom-tool/EHZrPlb9)

Change log
V1.20 2017.02.27
- MIDI fix so that triode plays nicely with MIDI clock

V1.11 2016.11.23
- Reverted filter decay envelope to use SUSTAIN switch, as in original release

V1.10 2016.11.12
- Updated MIDI code to exit interrupt immediately if MIDI command is unrecognized
- Increased front panel switch scanning rate (10X faster)
- Reduced pitchbend to 3 semitones
- Altered filter decay envelope to ignore SUSTAIN switch so that filter sweeps continue when key is released
- Removed digital pre-filtering code (previously used on OSC A&B)
- Removed digital enveloping of OSC A & B
- Gate oscillators when amplitude envelope hits zero (prevents audio bleed through)
- Changed filter cutoff curve (use table from MeeBlip SE)
- Scale filter cutoff knob to cover 25%-100% of knob range
- Scale filter resonance knob to cover 25%-100% of knob range
- Added bandlimited square wave tables (pulse waves were previously generated with offset sawtooth ramps)
- Raw calculated waveforms are now used in the lower 4 octaves, then switch to bandlimited wavetables.
-Flipped waveforms to match phase and avoid a pop when crossing the cut-over point

V1.01 2016.10.24
- Ensure MIDI channel settings are saved correctly when powered off for Channel 1-8 (implement MAXMIDI variable)
- Allow MIDI CC control of GLIDE knob to select waves when in wavetable mode (CC 61 now controls GLIDE in wavetable mode)
- Updated MIDI code to exit interrupt immediately if MIDI command is unrecognized
- Increased front panel switch scanning rate (10X faster)

V1.00 2016.10.19
- Initial release
